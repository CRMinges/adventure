Satellite phone
Lobby
A bulky satellite phone. On it is a note that read "EMERGENCY USE ONLY". You turn it on and it 
has a faint signal. If you can get outside, possibly to higher ground it may work better. However,
 you must turn it off to conserve the battery, as it is almost dead.
END
Small note
